Understanding the JDK, JRM and JVM
Java Development Kit (JDK) is used by developer side because it has tools that can help build the app where as java runtime environment is a part of JDK but it has JVM and other supported files to run the program. Java Virtual Machine converts the byte code to machine code, here jvm is not platform independent because every machine has different compatibilty support.

Java is called interpreter language because byte code is runned line by line.

I am sharing what I learned in my Java course, starting from basic programs to advanced level.
Key Concepts: JDK, JRE, and JVM

JDK (Java Development Kit): Used by developers. It includes tools (like compiler javac) to write, compile, and build Java applications.
JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Part of JDK. It provides the libraries and JVM needed to run Java programs (but no development tools).
JVM (Java Virtual Machine): The core engine that runs Java programs. It converts bytecode (.class files) into machine code that the computer understands.

Important Points:

Java is platform-independent ("Write Once, Run Anywhere") because the bytecode is the same everywhere.
But JVM is platform-dependent — each operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS) has its own version of JVM to handle hardware differences.
Java is called a compiler-interpreter language (hybrid):
First, the compiler (javac) turns source code (.java) into bytecode.
Then, the JVM interprets or uses JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler to run the bytecode line by line or in optimized blocks.


This makes Java secure, portable, and efficient!
