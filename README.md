# Learning_Java
I am going to upload things which i learned in the java course with the basic programs to advance level programs
Understanding the JDK, JRM and JVM
Java Development Kit (JDK) is used by developer side because it has tools that can help build the app where as java runtime environment is a part of JDK but it has JVM and other supported files to run the program. Java Virtual Machine converts the byte code to machine code, here jvm is not platform independent because every machine has different compatibilty support.

Java is called interpreter language because byte code is runned line by line.
